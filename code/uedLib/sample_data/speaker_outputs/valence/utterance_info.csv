bookSpeakers,170,Mr. Sherlock Holmes-SignOfFour,"that our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand."
bookSpeakers,192,Dr. Watson-SignOfFour,"Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,"
bookSpeakers,220,Mr. Sherlock Holmes-SignOfFour,"Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, is Jonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron band round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand. The other man"
bookSpeakers,228,Emma-Emma,"that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions. You are his object--and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I thought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing that you want--consideration, independence, a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us."
bookSpeakers,245,Emma-Emma,"Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me."
bookSpeakers,268,Elizabeth-Persuasion,"Oh, no! I think not. Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins, we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve. If we were not related, it would not signify; but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours. We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level. There are several odd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors. The Crofts will associate with them."
bookSpeakers,346,Mr. Sherlock Holmes-SignOfFour,"So do I. I wouldn t answer for our safety now, if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy."
bookSpeakers,355,Mr. Sherlock Holmes-SignOfFour,"No; I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of ours ought to be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man must, I should think, be absolutely unique."
bookSpeakers,398,Elizabeth-Persuasion,"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,"
bookSpeakers,400,Elizabeth-Persuasion,"I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints. However, when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together. They appear to so much advantage in company with each other. Each behaving so pleasantly. Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect."
bookSpeakers,402,Elizabeth-Persuasion,"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words. If you will have such ideas! But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men."
bookSpeakers,405,Elizabeth-Persuasion,"I have nothing to send but my love. Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, and pretend I have read it through. I really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out. Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications. You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night. I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her at the concert. Something so formal and _arrang _ in her air! and she sits so upright! My best love, of course."
bookSpeakers,406,Mr. Darcy-PrideAndPrejudice,"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."
bookSpeakers,431,Mr. Darcy-PrideAndPrejudice,"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,"
bookSpeakers,435,Elizabeth-PrideAndPrejudice,You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.
bookSpeakers,473,Mr. Sherlock Holmes-SignOfFour,"In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions? They send him messages what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best."
bookSpeakers,482,Mr. Sherlock Holmes-SignOfFour,"and going like the devil! Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with the yellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us!"
bookSpeakers,654,Elizabeth-PrideAndPrejudice,I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?
bookSpeakers,764,Elizabeth-PrideAndPrejudice,"This will not do,"
bookSpeakers,895,Emma-Emma,"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the best offer she was likely to have."
bookSpeakers,1056,Elizabeth-PrideAndPrejudice,it will then be early enough for expectation.
bookSpeakers,1141,Elizabeth-PrideAndPrejudice,"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"
bookSpeakers,1186,Elizabeth-PrideAndPrejudice,"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."
bookSpeakers,1525,Emma-Emma,"I will promise to call you once by your Christian name. I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse."
bookSpeakers,1583,Emma-Emma,"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am sure it was a consolation to you."
