# Emotion Dynamics

<!-- Emotion dynamics is a framework for measuring how an individual’s emotions change over time. [Hipson and Mohammad](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256153) first introduced the framework and applied it to a dataset of movie dialogues. Their Utterance Emotion Dynamics (UED) framework quantifies emotion state in a 2-dimensional elliptical space of valence--arousal. Their R code can be found at https://github.com/whipson/edyn. 

Here, we re-formulate the emotion dynamics framework along uni-dimensional axes of valence, arousal, and dominance, and provide Python scripts that can be used to appy the analysis to any temporally-ordered text. -->
Emotion dynamics is a framework from Psychology for measuring how an individual’s emotional state changes over time ([Hollenstein, 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1754073915590621); [Kuppens and Verduyn, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X16302019?via%3Dihub)). [Hipson and Mohammad (2020)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256153) introduced an analogous framework for changes in emotional state associated with one's utterances. They refer to it as Utterance Emotion Dynamics (UED). Specifically, they proposed a set of metrics (such as home base, density, variability, rise rate, etc.) that quantify various characteristics of change in one's emotional state as reflected in their utterances. This Python package allows the user to calculate these UED metrics from text.

To calculate the UED metrics one needs to specify:

1. Utterances by various speakers
2. Temporal information about the utterances, for e.g., time stamps associated with the utterances, or simply an ordering of utterances by time (even if the exact time of utterance is not known)
3. How to capture emotion states associated with the text 

This package allows one to capture emotion states using features drawn from emotion lexicons such as the <a href="http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/nrc-vad.html">NRC VAD Lexicon</a>. Rolling windows of words (moving forward one-word at a time) determine the sequence of emotional states. (UED metrics can be calculated using other forms of emotion features too, e.g., predictions of supervised emotion detection systems on individual utterances; however, that is not supported yet.) Further details about the code and input specifications can be found in the [code](https://github.com/Priya22/EmotionDynamics/tree/master/code) folder of this repository.

## What does this repository provide?

This repository consists of two main submodules:

1. Code to run the Emotion Dynamics framework. The code has been designed to work with any temporally-ordered text data, including but not limited to tweets. See the Readme within the [`code`](https://github.com/Priya22/TweetDynamics/tree/master/code) folder for further instructions.

2. The TUSC tweet dataset described in the paper [Tweet Emotion Dynamics:
Emotion Word Usage in Tweets from US and Canada](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04862).

## Where can you use the Emotion Dynamics framework?
The framework can be used to characterize the emotional state and trajectory of a speaker via their textual utterances over a period of time. [Hipson and Mohammad](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256153) apply it to analyze characters in a corpus of movie dialogues. The `code` folder of this repository shows a sample usage on character dialogue in literary novels. Our Tweet Dyanmics work applies it to individual tweeters -- one can do so with other data as well (e.g., posts from Reddit, self-reported diaries, political discussions, etc.).

### Hipson and Mohammed (2021)
[Hipson and Mohammad](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256153) apply the UED framework to utterances from a corpus of movie dialogues, which are naturally ordered along a temporal axis. 
They represented emotional state in a two-dimensional valence--arousal space. The co-ordinates are determined by the average valence and arousal scores of the words (using the NRC VAD lexicon)
in a small window of recent utterances (usually spanning 20 to 50 words).  Rolling windows of words (moving forward one-word at a time) determine the sequence of emotional states. Here, we apply that framework to tweets. However, in this work we consider each of the valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions separately (separate one-dimensional axes). Their R code can be found at https://github.com/whipson/edyn.

## What is Tweet Emotion Dynamics?

Tweet Emotion Dynamics, or TED, is a set of metrics that quantify the emotional characteristics of a set of tweets and tweeters. A large portion of the metrics are directly adapted from the Utterance Emotion Dynamics (UED) framework of [Hipson and Mohammad](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256153). 

These metrics can be broadly described by the following three questions:
1. On average, what is the emotion score of the tweets for a particular tweeter? (Section 4.1)
2. On average, how many tweets of a particular tweeter contain emotion-indicating words? (Section 4.2)
3. How can we quantify how the average emotionality of tweets varies over time, for a particular tweeter? (Utterance Emotion Dynamics; Section 5)

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Tweet IDs for `tusc-city` and `tusc-country` subsets. Each folder is split by city/country, and further by month. Each file contains the ID of the tweet. 
- `code/`: Code for running the emotion dynamics and emotion word usage analyses.
    - `clean_data.py`: functions to tokenize tweets and identify URLs.
    - `avgEmoValues.py`: functions to obtain number of tokens per tweet, number of lexicon tokens per tweet, and the average emotion value of words in that tweet, given an emotion lexicon.
    - `uedLib`/: code to run emotion dynamics on tweet data. 
        - `run_ued.py`: sample call to the main UED library.
        - `lib/ued.py`: main UED module that takes a config file as input and outputs emotion dynamic metrics.
        - `config/`: sample config files for running UED on (a) a single file; (b) a folder with multiple CSV files.

- `lexicons/`: Files with words and associated values for different emotion dimensions. 

    **Note**: Please see terms of use for these lexicons from their **original source** at http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/lexicons.html. If you wish to run the emotion dynamics code with any of these lexicons, please download from [the original source](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/lexicons.html]). The complete list of lexicons and their sources is described in the next section.

    This folder contains three main categories of lexicons for each of the valence-arousal-dominance dimensions:

    - `<dim>.csv`: The complete lexicon
    - `<dim>_polar.csv`: Does not contain words with a score between (0.33, 0.67).
    - `<dim>_low.csv`: Terms with scores <=0.33
    - `<dim>_high.csv`: Terms with scores >=0.67

    All lexicon files have two columns: `word` and `val`.

## Lexicons

The following lexicons are provided for ease of running the code in the `lexicons/` folder, but must be downloaded directly from the associated sources:
1. The `valence`, `arousal`, and `dominance` lexicons

    These are sourced from the [NRC-VAD Lexicon](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/nrc-vad.html). See terms of use at the bottom of the linked page. Cite the following work if you use these lexicons:
